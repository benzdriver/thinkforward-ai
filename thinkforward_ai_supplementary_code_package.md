   - Analyzes user profiles against immigration program requirements
   - Provides confidence scores and detailed factor analysis
   - Suggests specific improvements to increase eligibility

2. **Document Analysis**
   - Analyzes immigration documents for completeness and accuracy
   - Identifies issues and provides recommendations
   - Extracts key data from documents

3. **Regional Trends Analysis**
   - Visualizes historical immigration data
   - Provides AI-driven projections for future trends
   - Analyzes target occupation distributions

4. **Personalized Recommendations**
   - Generates tailored recommendations based on user profiles
   - Prioritizes recommendations by impact and confidence
   - Provides detailed reasoning and potential impact

## Integration Guide

### Using AI Components

1. **Import components from their respective directories:**
   ```tsx
   import { RegionalTrends, DocumentAnalyzer } from '../../components/canada/common';
   import { AIEligibilityAssessment, AIRecommendationEngine } from '../../components/canada/express-entry';
   ```

2. **Ensure the CanadianImmigrationProvider wraps your components:**
   ```tsx
   <CanadianImmigrationProvider>
     <YourComponent />
   </CanadianImmigrationProvider>
   ```

3. **Use the components with appropriate props:**
   ```tsx
   <RegionalTrends province={CanadianProvince.Ontario} />
   
   <AIEligibilityAssessment 
     profile={userProfile}
     program="Express Entry"
   />
   
   <DocumentAnalyzer document={documentSubmission} />
   
   <AIRecommendationEngine 
     profile={userProfile}
     onRecommendationSelect={handleRecommendation}
   />
   ```

### API Integration

The implementation includes both frontend and backend integration:

1. **Frontend AI Processing:**
   - Uses OpenAI client-side integration for immediate feedback
   - Requires NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

2. **Backend API Endpoints:**
   - All components attempt to call backend APIs first
   - Falls back to client-side processing if backend unavailable
   - Backend endpoints follow RESTful patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Create the backend API endpoints** to match the frontend integration
2. **Implement the missing types directory** in the actual codebase
3. **Add unit and integration tests** for the new components
4. **Enhance the AI models** with domain-specific training data
5. **Expand to additional Canadian immigration programs**

## Technical Requirements

- React 18+
- Next.js 13+
- TypeScript 4.9+
- OpenAI API access
- Recharts for visualizations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
