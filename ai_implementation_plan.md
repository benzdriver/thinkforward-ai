# AI Implementation Plan for ThinkForward AI

Based on the detailed code review and gap analysis, I'll now implement the missing AI-related components for ThinkForward AI's Canada market focus. This implementation will prioritize the most critical components first.

## Implementation Approach

1. Create the missing TypeScript interfaces in the `frontend/types/canada` directory
2. Implement AI integration in the Canadian Immigration Context
3. Create the missing RegionalTrends component with AI-powered analysis
4. Enhance existing components with AI capabilities

Let's begin with the implementation.
