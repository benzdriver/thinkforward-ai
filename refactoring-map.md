# ThinkForward AI Hybrid Architecture Refactoring Map

## Core Containerized Services
- User authentication and management
- Client core data management
- Session management
- Database operations
- Security and middleware
- Core API routes and controllers
- User profile management
- Client case management

## Serverless Functions
- AI-powered recommendations and analysis
- Document generation and processing
- Email notifications
- Report generation
- Periodic data synchronization
- Canadian immigration eligibility assessments
- Express Entry calculations
- Provincial Nominee Program evaluations
- Document analysis and validation
- Trend predictions and analytics

## API Gateway Structure
- Next.js API routes for serverless functions
- Express.js for containerized services
- Routing between serverless and containerized components

## Deployment Strategy
- Frontend: Deploy to Vercel as a Next.js application
- Backend: Split into serverless functions and containerized services
- Database: Use MongoDB Atlas for cloud database
- Authentication: Continue using Clerk for authentication

## Migration Path
1. Create serverless function infrastructure
2. Convert low-frequency operations to serverless functions
3. Update API client to support hybrid architecture
4. Configure MongoDB Atlas for production
5. Set up Vercel deployment
6. Test and verify functionality
